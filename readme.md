Hello and welcome to the toy mathematics project üëã!

The purpose of this project is to explore new cool mathematical objects! Yes you heard that right, it is possible to create completely new mathematical objects, while these objects build upon the foundationss of our science, the properties that they exhibit are not yet fully explored or solved. In this repo you will find interesting new mathematical objects.

Ideally, those who decide to explore this rabbit hole will be able to help each other research these new properties and interesting lil number thingies. It's unknown to me how much of an impact these math objects can make but I enjoy inventing and exploring them. If you are excited about mathematics and code, this will be a wild adventure for you. Most of the math posted here can be tested and "proved" with code! For each new math object we create we will provide extensive testing suits to play around with it. Now without further ado, lets delve... ü§ñü§ùü§ì

Our first proposal and contribution:

Here is the fully translated LaTeX version of the given equation:

# the morphing infinity spiral

$$
S_{\alpha, \beta}(z, t) = z^{\alpha} \cdot \exp\left(i \cdot t \cdot (\log(z))^{\beta}\right)
$$
